The easiest way to install espanso on Windows is by using the official installer.  **Note: espanso currently supports Windows 10 only**.

### Using the Installer

Download the installer by clicking on the button below and follow the instructions.

<div class="">
<a class="btn btn-lg mybtn mb-4" href="https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/latest/download/espanso-win-installer.exe" role="button">Download the Installer</a>
</div>

If you completed the installation procedure, you should have espanso running.
A good way to find out is by going on any text field and typing `:espanso`. 
You should see "Hi there!" appear.

At this point, you are ready to read the [Getting Started](/docs/get-started/) tutorial.

### Problems you may experience

Because espanso is not digitally signed, you may experience a warning from
Windows Smartscreen. In this case, just click on "More info" (1) and then
on "Run anyway" (2), as shown in the picture:
