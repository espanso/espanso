#### What is a Text Expander?

A *text expander* is a program that detects when you type
a specific **keyword** and replaces it with **something else**. 
This is useful in many ways:
* **Save a lot of typing**, expanding common sentences.
* Create **system-wide** code snippets.
* Execute **custom scripts**
* Use **emojis** like a pro.

## Get Started

Visit the [official documentation](https://espanso.org/docs/).

## Wayland support

Please look at the documentation for details. Application specific filters
(filter_title, filter_class, filter_exec) currently only work und Wayland with Gnome
version 41. In addition, a Gnome shell extension
(https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4974/window-calls-extended/)
is required! Without this extension, espanso has no access to active window information.
