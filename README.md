#### What is a Text Expander?

A *text expander* is a program that detects when you type
a specific **keyword** and replaces it with **something else**. 
This is useful in many ways:
* **Save a lot of typing**, expanding common sentences.
* Create **system-wide** code snippets.
* Execute **custom scripts**
* Use **emojis** like a pro.
