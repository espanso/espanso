  ## What is a Text Expander?

  A text expander is a program that detects when you type
  a specific keyword and replaces it with something else.
  This is useful in many ways:
  * Save a lot of typing, expanding common sentences.
  * Create system-wide code snippets.
  * Execute custom scripts
  * Use emojis like a pro.
